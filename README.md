This makeshift website was made in order to display a portion of the javascript knowledge needed to create a dynamic ecommerce website. I focused on making the functionality for a favorites list, but there is functionality related to other aspects of a changing website, such as using given information to display unique html elements that were created dynamically. Though the website itself does not have much in the way of graphical design, I hope it displays my proficiency in the DOM API.

Some key notes about the documents in this file:

index.html is a very skeletal html document so that nodes and their attributes can be added to the file without many conflicting elements.
styles.css changes the attributes of only three element types in index.html simply to make it easier for me to work and test the functionality while coding.
main.js has 300 lines of code, all of which is extensively commented. main.js is dedicated to making index.html a very responsive file.
